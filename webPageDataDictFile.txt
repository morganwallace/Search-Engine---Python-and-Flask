Originally known as the School of Information Management and Systems (SIMS), this research-and-learning enterprise became the School of Information in 2006. The ISchool traces its roots to the 1920s, when UC Berkeley founded its School of Librarianship, ensuring universal access to information and educating "knowledge" professionals well before the age of the Internet. In 1976 the School of Librarianship became the School of Library and Information Studies. The ISchool proudly carries forward its library school heritage through its alumni, and through an enduring commitment to making information accessible, useful, and relevant. Timeline 1918 - UC Berkeley establishes a department of library science in the undergraduate College of Letters and Science. 1926 - The department of library science becomes the graduate School of Librarianship, with associate university librarian Sydney Mitchell as its founding dean. Initially the school offers a one-year certificate of librarianship; in 1947, the bachelor of library science degree is authorized. In 1955, with an expanded curriculum, this became the master                of library science. In 1954, the university authorized advanced programs for the degrees of doctor of library science and doctor of philosophy. 1976 - The School of Librarianship is renamed the School of Library and Information Studies (SLIS). 1994 - The university establishes the School of Information Management and Systems (SIMS) on the foundation of the previous School of Library and Information Studies. The school offers the master of information management and systems (MIMS), a new professional master\'s degree, as well as an academic Ph.D. degree. The first students in the new master\'s program are admitted in Fall 1997. 2006 - The School of Information Management and Systems is renamed the School of Information.

Built in 1873, it is the oldest building on the Berkeley          campus. South Hall is located in the heart of campus, near the Doe Library          and the Campanile (Sather Tower). Its charming architectural style and spacious hallways create an atmosphere that encourages faculty, students, and staff to mingle and interact, giving the ISchool the feel of a small school in the center of a vibrant world-class university. History of South Hall On March 29, 1868, the California State Legislature granted a charter          for the organization of a state university to be known as the University          of California. Land for this purpose was acquired in Berkeley. In 1869          the first classes were held in temporary quarters in Oakland. Forty students          were enrolled. The legislature commissioned David Farquharson, a Scottish architect          who also designed the first State Capitol Building and the original building          of the First Bank of California, located in San Francisco, to design the          original buildings. The campus plan called for the erection of six spacious          and elegant buildings that would house the colleges of Agriculture, Mechanic          Arts, Civil Engineering, Mines and Letters. These buildings would be grouped          around a central library building designated as the Hall of California. Anxious to begin construction of the new campus, the Board of Regents          decided to use funds on hand and authorized the laying of the foundations          for the College of Letters and the College of Agriculture, to be known          as North and South Halls, respectively. Work commenced in May, but the          limited funds soon expired. In 1872 the legislature appropriated $300,000          for the completion of these two buildings. South Hall was completed in          1873 for a total cost of $197,000. Its four stories contain 29,500 square          feet. Dreams of a central library building were finally realized in 1877 when          H.D. Bacon donated $25,000 for this purpose, and Bacon Hall was erected.          Ultimately, five of Farquharson\'s original six buildings were constructed. South Hall stands as the sole survivor of the original university nucleus.          In addition to the College of Agriculture, South Hall also housed laboratories          for the physical and natural sciences. Over the years it has also housed          the Business School, Department of Economics, Political Science and Sociology,          and the Library School. The oldest building on campus, South Hall is now          home to the newest professional school, the School of Information. The building\'s importance lies in its being a rare example, particularly          on the West Coast, of a European architectural style which swept the country          in the last half of the 19th century. South Hall\'s structure may represent          an early, conscious attempt to design an earthquake-proof building. The          structural system of walls of brick cells rather than continuous masonry          certainly reveals an early approach to fireproofing. In fact, this aspect          of the building and not its style gave south Hall a higher preservation          priority than North Hall, razed in 1917, and Bacon Hall, razed in 1961.     South Hall, 2007 (photo: David Schmitz)  Building Description South Hall exhibits the stylistic traits of the Second Empire Style,          although modified in its decorative detail. The mansard roof is enlivened          by banks of dormers with ornamental hood moldings, oiel de boeuf windows,          iron cresting, and numerous chimneys and exhaust flues for the former          chemistry labs. Beneath the bracketed cornice on the North and South facades          are low relief panels of cast iron coated with sand paint depicting the          state\'s native fruits and grains. The East facade, now the most visible,          has a central block with wings marked by separate roof forms and exterior          chimney breasts. A modified form of fluted cast iron pilaster reinforces          the buildings corners and marks the division between the wings and central          block. A variety of window heads and moldings are used throughout the          building. The molded, cast iron windows and spandrels strengthen the horizontal          division between the first and second floors. The ground floor is treated          with a rusticated stone base. The main entry stair to South Hall originally faced west, but was removed          to the eastern facade after the construction of Wheeler Hall. The structure          of the porch, wood painted to simulate stone, was replaced in 1997 with          glass fiber reinforced concrete. The entrance porch has segmental arches          and square corner supports surmounted by a balustrade with urn-like finials.          Stairs descend to the right and the left. Overall, the building is detailed          in a lively, eclectic manner with such notable features as satyric heads          anchoring the tops of the downspouts to the walls. The interior of the building boasts 25 foot ceilings and wood wainscoting          throughout the spacious hallways. Doorways have generous wood molding,          and the central stairway is surrounded by a magnificent wood banister.          This central stair originally connected all four floors, but more recent          fire codes required modification. In 1968, in celebration of the University\'s          centennial and under the direction of Prof. Kenneth Cardwell, the building          was renovated. At that time, the stair between the second and third floors          was blocked and stairways in enclosed shafts at either end of the hall          were added. In more recent years, an elevator and wheel chair ramp were added. South          Hall underwent an earthquake retrofit in the mid 1980\'s. Excerpted from the "Campus Historic Resources Survey" (1978). Current Facilities The primary classroom is 202 South Hall, also known as the FlexLab, which has reconfigurable tables and chairs and built-in large-screen projectors and audio. The CoLab (110 South Hall) is a flexible space with a lounge area as well as movable tables, chairs, and white boards, to support informal meetings, group work, and individual study. Student lounges and work spaces on the ground floor support individual and group work. Wireless networking is available in all classrooms.       /node-inner, /node         Print Email Share      /block-inner, /block              \r     Copyright  19952013 UC Regents     /block-inner, /block     RSS & iCal feeds    /block-inner, /block                  Last updated:        March 13, 2012        /block-inner, /block         ', 'ID': 9, 'Title': 'About South Hall | School of Information'}, 10: {'URL': 'http://ischool.berkeley.edu/about/advisoryboard', 'Text': b'                UC Berkeley Alumni Network Contact Us Support the I School Intranet     /block-inner, /block        About Contact Us Dean\'s Welcome Visitor Information History South Hall Advisory Board I School Jobs News & Events News Press Coverage Alumni News Events Events Archive Distinguished Lecture Series Dean\'s Lectures Information Access Seminar Design Futures Lectures Technology, Information, and Education Seminar Series Audio & Video Course Videos Programs MIMS Program Degree Requirements Summer Internship Final Project Chen Awards 2013 Projects Ph.D. Program Degree Requirements Completed Dissertations Courses Course Schedule: Spring 2013 Course Schedule: Summer 2013 Course Schedule: Fall 2013 Course Catalog People Faculty Office Hours Students MIMS Directory MIMS 2013 Class Directory MIMS 2014 Class Directory Ph.D. Directory Student Groups Staff Visitors Featured Profiles Featured Students Featured Alumni Centers & Clinics Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative (ECAI) Information and Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD) Center for Next Generation Teaching and Learning Affiliated Centers Research Research Areas Computer-mediated Communication Data Science Design Entrepreneurship Human-computer Interaction (HCI) Information Economics Information Organization Information Policy Information Retrieval & Search Information Visualization Law Management Privacy Security Social & Cultural Studies Technology for Developing Regions User Experience Research Archived Projects Publications Admissions MIMS Application Instructions Ph.D. Application Instructions FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) For International Applicants Visit Us Admissions Events Request Information Careers Career Paths Student Resources Seeking an Internship Employer Resources Offering an Internship Student Skills     /block-inner, /block     Log In Username: *    Password: *       Forgot your password?     /block-inner, /block     Home  About  Advisory Board Advisory Board   /#content-header        The I School Advisory Board is made up of respected business leaders, technologists, and creative thinkers from Silicon Valley and beyond.

The first year of the program consists mostly of a core curriculum; the second year involves further study in core areas along with additional electives, with the expectation that the student will specialize in particular aspects of information management and systems, as well as complete a final project requirement. During the summer between the two years, students are strongly encouraged to participate in an internship program in order to use their newly acquired skills in real-world settings. Assistance in arranging internships will be provided whenever possible, but the ultimate responsibility of obtaining the internship will be that of the student. Past internships have been in corporate, academic, government and non-profit institutions. First Year Required Courses There are four required courses in the first year:  202. Information Organization and Retrieval 203. Social and Organizational Issues of Information and Society 205. Information Law and Policy 206. Distributed Computing Applications and infrastructure  The remaining units for the first and second semesters are composed of electives. Second Year, MIMS Program The second year of the program will be devoted to electives both within the I School and in other units on campus. During the final semester of the second year students will, working in groups, undertake final projects. The interdisciplinary diversity of the I School program makes many kinds of projects suitable. Some projects involve the design of an information-intensive application and creation of a software artifact. Other projects include a significant research component, making a written report the most important artifact. In conjunction with the final project, students should also take a professional skills workshop during the final semester of the second year.  209: Professional Skills Workshop  Summary of Course and Unit Requirements  202.

Distributed Computing Applications and Infrastructure (Students with substantial technical backgrounds canwaive 206 by exam.) Additonal two- or three-unit course, taken from an approved list of technology courses   Two- or three-unit Management requirement, taken from an approved list of management courses. During the second year of the program, each student must complete 2 units of 298A with their advisor as part of the final project requirement.  All degree requirements must be taken on a letter grade basis. Further courses to satisfy the 48 unit requirement may be chosen from the School's course catalog or from courses in other departments, with approval. Students may use 100- or 200-level courses towards the completion of their degree. A maximum of 10 units from other departments will be accepted as counting toward the MIMS degree. Courses from other departments must be upper division or graduate courses numbered in the 100-299 range and must be approved by an ISchool faculty advisor before credit will be accepted toward the degree. A maximum of 4 units of Individual Study (Info 299) will count toward the degree and a maximum of 2 units of Field Study (297) will count toward the degree. Work toward the degree must be completed with a grade point average of at least B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale). Students may elect to take courses on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis up to a limit of one third (i.e., 16 units) of the total units applied toward the degree. Length of the MIMS Program The MIMS program is considered a full-time program. Students are expected to enroll in 12 units of graduate work each semester and complete the program within the two-year time frame. Students are required to be registered for four consecutive semesters.       /node-inner, /node         Print Email Share      /block-inner, /block    Student Profile         Laura Wishingrad   MIMS Student Class of 2013 The I School attracts people from all sorts of backgrounds, and brings us together in a collaborative environment.

General Guidelines  Job responsibilities should consist of professional level work suitable to the skills and knowledge of graduate students. If possible, job activities should center around a project that can be completed within the summer time frame (a maximum of 12 weeks). Negotiations regarding duration, extent of, and compensation for the internship are between employer and student. If at all possible, students should report to a designated person responsible for guidance and supervision of the project. Although a formal report to the ISchool at the end of the internship is not required, the ISchool welcomes feedback from both employers and students regarding the experience. Upon successful completion of the project, students should receive an evaluative report on their work from the supervisor.  Getting an Internship Internship arrangements are negotiated between employer and individual student. The ISchool encourages students to post resumes that describe their skills and availability for summer work. Non-Profit Internships: Supplementary Funding Grants in amounts up to $6000 will be available to a limited number of MIMS students serving in internships with non-profits, government agencies, or non-governmental agencies (NGOs) in the U.S. or abroad, during the summer between their first and second year in the program. Past grant recipients have held internships at Code for America, the National Parks Conservation Association, National Public Radio, Pivot Learning, Plan Benin, Root Capital, and UC Berkeley. A selection committee of of faculty and staff determine awards based on funding availability and fit with the mission of the grant program. Application instructions (for current students) Summer Break at Berkeley The spring semester usually ends by May 20, and the fall semester begins the last week of August. A full summer internship could last for approximately 12 weeks. However, some employers and students might wish to negotiate a shorter time frame.       /node-inner, /node         Print Email Share      /block-inner, /block    Student Profile         Dave Lester   MIMS Student Class of 2013  Berkeleys masters program stands out from all other programs by balancing its core curriculum with coursework that reflects current trends and practices from technology leaders in the Bay Area.        /block-inner, /block   MIMS Career Paths  Learn more about careers that our master's degree graduates have pursued: ISchool Career Paths    /block-inner, /block   Student Project         iNaturalist.org   An online community meeting the informational needs of amateur naturalists.        /block-inner, /block              \r     Copyright  19952013 UC Regents     /block-inner, /block     RSS & iCal feeds    /block-inner, /block                  Last updated:        January 23, 2013        /block-inner, /block         ", 'ID': 28, 'Title': 'Summer Internship | School of Information'}, 29: {'URL': 'http://ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims/projects', 'Text': b'                UC Berkeley Alumni Network Contact Us Support the I School Intranet     /block-inner, /block        About Contact Us Dean\'s Welcome Visitor Information History South Hall Advisory Board I School Jobs News & Events News Press Coverage Alumni News Events Events Archive Distinguished Lecture Series Dean\'s Lectures Information Access Seminar Design Futures Lectures Technology, Information, and Education Seminar Series Audio & Video Course Videos Programs MIMS Program Degree Requirements Summer Internship Final Project Chen Awards 2013 Projects Ph.D. Program Degree Requirements Completed Dissertations Courses Course Schedule: Spring 2013 Course Schedule: Summer 2013 Course Schedule: Fall 2013 Course Catalog People Faculty Office Hours Students MIMS Directory MIMS 2013 Class Directory MIMS 2014 Class Directory Ph.D. Directory Student Groups Staff Visitors Featured Profiles Featured Students Featured Alumni Centers & Clinics Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative (ECAI) Information and Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD) Center for Next Generation Teaching and Learning Affiliated Centers Research Research Areas Computer-mediated Communication Data Science Design Entrepreneurship Human-computer Interaction (HCI) Information Economics Information Organization Information Policy Information Retrieval & Search Information Visualization Law Management Privacy Security Social & Cultural Studies Technology for Developing Regions User Experience Research Archived Projects Publications Admissions MIMS Application Instructions Ph.D. Application Instructions FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) For International Applicants Visit Us Admissions Events Request Information Careers Career Paths Student Resources Seeking an Internship Employer Resources Offering an Internship Student Skills     /block-inner, /block     Log In Username: *    Password: *       Forgot your password?     /block-inner, /block     Home  Programs  MIMS Program  MIMS Final Projects MIMS Final Projects   /#content-header        During the final semester of their second year, I School MIMS students undertake final projects.

The School of Information draws on the expertise not only of its own faculty but of the full Berkeley campus. We encourage students to take full advantage of being at this world-class University and not feel bound by disciplinary boundaries. The Ph.D. degree program at the School of Information is a research program. Each student is expected to work with his or her advisor to ensure that the program of study includes:  A thorough understanding of research methods and research design The ability to review current research critically The ability to understand emerging trends from an inter-disciplinary perspective.  Expected Ph.D. timeline:  Semester 1: Identify a Faculty Advisor Semesters 14: Complete breadth courses; complete major and minor requirements Semester 4: Complete the Preliminary Research Paper Semester 5: Complete Preliminary Exam Semester 68: Complete Qualifying Exam; advance to Candidacy Four semesters after Qualifying Exam: Complete dissertation and give presentation  1. Identify a Research Advisor In most cases, the research advisor will work with the student throughout the students advancement at the School of Information, and ultimately become the chair of the students Dissertation Committee. 2. Complete Breadth Courses Students take one course from each of the four breadth areas (Foundation; Engineering and Design; Social Aspects of Information; and Information Economics, Law and Policy). In addition, students are expected to enroll in the Doctoral Colloquium (INFO 295) every semester until they pass the Qualifying Examination. 3. Complete Major and Minor Requirements Students take 24 units of coursework in three areas to complete their major and minor requirements. They can select one major (12 units) and two minors (6 units each), or two majors (9 units each) and one minor (6 units). At least one of the majors must be a field inside the School  of Information. At least 6 units of coursework must be taken outside the School  of Information. Major and minor areas include:  Human-Computer      Interaction Information      Economics and Policy Information      Law and Policy Information      Organization and Retrieval Information      Systems Design Social      Aspects of Information Information      and Communication Technologies and Development  If a student wishes to propose a major or minor area other than these, the student must petition the Head Graduate Advisor. 4. Complete the Preliminary Research Paper Students must complete a research paper that is judged to be of quality sufficient to be published in a well-respected journal or research conference. 5. Pass the Preliminary Exam After completing coursework and the Preliminary Research Paper, students can take the Preliminary Exam. Students are expected to take the Preliminary Exam during their 5th semester in the program. Students form a Preliminary Exam Committee with three members: all should be UC Berkeley faculty and at least two should be from the School  of Information. The first step towards taking the Preliminary Exam is for the student to write a summary and synthesis of his or her work up to this point, to give the committee an overview of the students work, and to allow the student to reflect upon and synthesize his or her work. The Preliminary Exam consists of the following steps: (a) all Committee members judge that the Preliminary Research Paper is publishable; (b) the Committee members prepare questions (1-3 questions per member); (c) the Committee Chair compiles the questions into a written exam; (d) the student takes the exam in a 24 hour open-book, open-note format; (e) all three members confer and determine if the student passes the Preliminary Exam. 6. Pass the Qualifying Exam Ph.D. students preparing for the Qualifying Exam should carefully review Section F2.8 of the Graduate Divisions Guide to Graduate Policy. The Qualifying Examination Committee must consist of at least four faculty members, at least one of whom must be an Academic Senate member from outside the School of Information. The School  of Information requires that the student prepare a detailed Dissertation Proposal prior to taking the Qualifying Exam. The student is also advised to prepare a slide presentation relating to the Dissertation Proposal. At its discretion the Committee may ask:  Questions relating the general fields of the Dissertation Proposal Questions regarding the specific Dissertation Proposal Any other questions that test the students preparation to commence Candidacy.  The purpose of the Qualifying Examination is to test the student's general mastery of his or her field of study. The faculty should determine whether the candidate is ready to enter the research phase of graduate studies, but the exam is not to be concerned solely with the proposed dissertation research. 7. Advance to Candidacy After passing the Qualifying Examination, students must submit the Application for Candidacy to the Doctoral Degree, Plan B. For the School of Information, the Normative Time to Advancement to Candidacy is 8 semesters from the start of the Ph.D. Program. For those students who began in the MIMS program, the Normative Time to Advancement to Candidacy in the Ph.D. Program is 10 semesters from the start of the MIMS Program. 8. Complete the Dissertation The Ph.D. Dissertation represents the cumulative accomplishment of the Ph.D. process. The Ph.D. Dissertation must be an original and significant contribution to research. The Dissertation is supervised by the students Dissertation Committee. The student is expected to meet regularly with the committee throughout the dissertation process. For the School of Information, the Normative Time in Candidacy is 4 semesters. Therefore, students are expected to file their dissertations within 4 semesters of advancing to Candidacy. 9. Give a Public Presentation on the Dissertation Ph.D. students give a public presentation on their completed dissertation research. The presentation allows faculty and students to ask questions about the research as part of the research presentation.       /node-inner, /node         Print Email Share      /block-inner, /block    Student Profile         Jen King   Ph.D. Student Focus: Information privacy and policy, social networks, sensor networks (video surveillance, RFID).        /block-inner, /block              \r     Copyright  19952013 UC Regents     /block-inner, /block     RSS & iCal feeds    /block-inner, /block                  Last updated:        October 5, 2009        /block-inner, /block         ", 'ID': 33, 'Title': 'Ph.D. Program Requirements | School of Information'}, 34: {'URL': 'http://ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/phd/dissertations', 'Text': b"                UC Berkeley Alumni Network Contact Us Support the I School Intranet     /block-inner, /block        About Contact Us Dean's Welcome Visitor Information History South Hall Advisory Board I School Jobs News & Events News Press Coverage Alumni News Events Events Archive Distinguished Lecture Series Dean's Lectures Information Access Seminar Design Futures Lectures Technology, Information, and Education Seminar Series Audio & Video Course Videos Programs MIMS Program Degree Requirements Summer Internship Final Project Chen Awards 2013 Projects Ph.D. Program Degree Requirements Completed Dissertations Courses Course Schedule: Spring 2013 Course Schedule: Summer 2013 Course Schedule: Fall 2013 Course Catalog People Faculty Office Hours Students MIMS Directory MIMS 2013 Class Directory MIMS 2014 Class Directory Ph.D. Directory Student Groups Staff Visitors Featured Profiles Featured Students Featured Alumni Centers & Clinics Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative (ECAI) Information and Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD) Center for Next Generation Teaching and Learning Affiliated Centers Research Research Areas Computer-mediated Communication Data Science Design Entrepreneurship Human-computer Interaction (HCI) Information Economics Information Organization Information Policy Information Retrieval & Search Information Visualization Law Management Privacy Security Social & Cultural Studies Technology for Developing Regions User Experience Research Archived Projects Publications Admissions MIMS Application Instructions Ph.D. Application Instructions FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) For International Applicants Visit Us Admissions Events Request Information Careers Career Paths Student Resources Seeking an Internship Employer Resources Offering an Internship Student Skills     /block-inner, /block     Log In Username: *    Password: *       Forgot your password?     /block-inner, /block     Home  Programs  Ph.D. Program  Completed Dissertations Completed Dissertations   /#content-header     2012   Christo Sims.

Social and Organizational Issues of Information (4units)  Instructor(s): Jenna Burrell  Time: TuTh 11-12:30 Location: 170 Barrows CCN: 41566 Website This course is designed to be an introduction to the topics and issues associated with the study of information and information technology, from a social science perspective. As a result, this course will continuously introduce students to applied and practical problems, theoretical issues, as well as methods for answering different types of questions. The following three questions will guide the material throughout the course: 1) Why do social scientists study information and information technology, 2) What are some of the key topics and issues that are studied, and 3) How do we study these issues? As we work our way through many different topics and problems in information, we will focus on various levels of analysis. This includes the micro (i.e., interpersonal relationships and information in small groups) to the macro level (i.e., organizational and institutional problems of information). By the end of the course, all students will be familiar with the social science approach to information and information technology, as well as many of the key problems and the methods used to solve these problems. This knowledge is essential to having a well-rounded understanding of information issues in professional environments. NOTE: This course was offered for 3 units in Spring 2010 and Spring 2011.     Info 206.

Professional Skills Workshop (2units)  Instructor(s): Michael Schaffer  Time: F 12:00 -2:00 Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41575 As information and information systems projects have become increasingly strategic, information workers at all levels and in all environments must demonstrate higher levels of professionalism, not only to perform their duties competently, but to remain competitive in the job market. This course, in conjunction with the School of Information final project, gives students insight into the source and best practice of professionalism, and gives students the chance to refine the essential skills in a simulated but realistic working environment. Note: This course is being offered on a S/U (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory) basis.  General Courses    Info 214. Needs and Usability Assessment (3units)  Instructor(s): Elizabeth GoodmanNancy Van House  Time: TuTh 12:30-2 Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41581 Website This course addresses concepts and methods of user experience research. The emphasis will be on methods of collecting and interpreting many kinds of data about real-world user activities and practices and translating them into design decisions. The course includes hands-on practice with a number of major user experience research methods, including heuristic evaluation; observation; interviews, surveys and focus groups.  The emphasis will be on naturalistic/ethnographic (qualitative) methods, but we will also address major quantitative methods. Finally, we will discuss methods of bringing user experience research into the design process. This course is appropriate for both 1st and 2nd-year MIMS students, and for students from other departments with a strong interest in user experience research, with the instructor\'s permission. Students will complete at least one major group project related to needs assessment and evaluation. Second-year MIMS students may use this project to meet their capping project requirement.     Info 216. Computer-Mediated Communication (3units)  Instructor(s): Andrew FioreCoye Cheshire  Time: W 9-12 Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41584 Website This course covers the practical and theoretical issues associated with computer-mediated communication (CMC) systems. CMC includes many different types of technologies such as email, newsgroups, chat, and online games. We will focus on the analysis of CMC practices, the social structures that emerge when people use these applications, and the design and implementation issues associated with constructing CMC technologies. We will primarily take a social scientific approach to computer-mediated communication (including research from psychology, social psychology, economics, and sociology). We will investigate questions such as: How do we represent identity and perceive others in CMC environments? How are interfaces and visualizations used in CMC to help make sense of relationships? Why do some Wikis "succeed" while others do not? How is the production of open source software such as Linux similar to (and different from) a social movement? Why are reputations useful in some online environments, and not in others? Can we really develop meaningful relationships and perhaps even love-purely through CMC? This course was previously offered as INFO 290-12.     Info 218. Concepts of Information (3units)  Instructor(s): Geoffrey NunbergPaul Duguid  Time: TuTh 1-2:30 Location: 107 South Hall CCN: 41587 Website Three hours of lecture per week.  Prerequisites: Graduate standing. As it\'s generally used, "information" is a collection of notions, rather than a single coherent concept. In this course, we\'ll examine conceptions of information based in information theory, philosophy, social science, economics, and history. Issues include: How compatible are these conceptions; can we talk about "information" in the abstract? What work do these various notions play in discussions of literacy, intellectual property, advertising, and the political process? And where does this leave "information studies" and "the information society"?     Info 225. Managing in Information-Intensive Companies (3units)  Instructor(s): Morten Hansen  Time: F 9-12 Location: 202 South Hall CCN: 41590 Website This course focuses on managing people in information-intensive firms and industries, such as information technology industries. Students who seek careers in these industries will soon be asked to manage people, teams, departments, and units. They need to learn how to manage. However, managing is sometimes very different in these settings: Employees are highly educated; work is more fluid; teamwork and collaboration are essential; and external situations and strategies change rapidly. For these reasons several management principles born in a traditional manufacturing era no longer apply. In particular, the old style of command and control needs to give way to more distributed ways of work, with significant consequences for how managers need to manage. Of course, some universal management principles apply no matter what circumstance.  While we will cover these universal management principles in this course, we will pay particular attention to management issues that are highly relevant in information-intensive settings. Topics to be covered will likely include: managing knowledge workers; managing teams (incl. virtual ones); collaborating across disparate units, giving and receiving feedback;  managing the innovation process (incl. in eco-systems); managing through networks; and managing when using communication tools (e.g., tele-presence). The course will rely heavily on cases as a pedagogical form.  May not be taken for credit if student has previously taken INFO 290, Section 1 (Spring 2009) or Section 6 (Fall 2009) This course satisfies the Management of Information Projects & Organizations requirement.     Info 231. Economics of Information (3units)  Instructor(s): Paul Laskowski  Time: TuTh 2-3:30 Location: 202 South Hall CCN: 41596 Website This course examines information from an economic perspective.  We will introduce a range of seminal theories that describe how information is created, shared, and valued.  Our focus covers both the role of information in the general economy, as well as the specific behavior of information markets.  Topics will include information technology, knowledge production, markets with hidden information, digital goods, and networks.  While this is a theoretical course, the tools and insights it provides may benefit any student navigating issues in the information economy.     Info 235. Cyberlaw (3units)  Instructor(s): Chris HoofnagleDaphne Keller  Time: MW 2-3:30 Location: 202 South Hall CCN: 41599 Three hours of lecture per week. The emergence of global digital networks, such as the Internet, and digital technologies that enhance human abilities to access, store, manipulate, and transmit vast amounts of information has brought with it a host of new legal issues that lawyers preparing to practice in the 21st century will need to understand and address. Although many are trying to "map" existing legal concepts onto problems arising in cyberspace, it is becoming increasingly evident that this strategy sometimes doesn\'t work. In some cases, it is necessary to go back to first principles to understand how to accomplish the purposes of existing law in digital networked environments. The course will explore specific problems in applying law to cyberspace in areas such as intellectual property, privacy, content control, and the bounds of jurisdiction. Students with familiarity with the Internet and its resources or with backgrounds in some of the substantive fields explored in this course are especially welcome, but there are no formal prerequisites. Grades for the course will be based either on a series of short papers or on a supervised term paper.  Note: This course is cross-listed with Law 276.1.     Info 240. Principles of Information Retrieval (3units)  Instructor(s): Ray Larson  Time: MW 11-12:30 Location: 205 South Hall CCN: 41602 Website Three hours of lecture per week. Theories and methods for searching and retrieval of text and bibliographic information. Analysis of relevance and utility. Statistical and linguistic methods for automatic indexing and classification. Boolean and probabilistic approaches to indexing, query formulation, and output ranking. Filtering methods. Measures of retrieval effectiveness and retrieval experimentation methodology.  This course is intended to prepare you to understand the underlying theories and algorithms of advanced information retrieval systems and to introduce the methodology for the design and evaluation of information retrieval systems. The course will introduce you to the major types of information retrieval systems, the different theoretical foundations underlying these systems, and the methods and measures that can be used to evaluate them. The course will focus on the both the theoretical aspects of information retrieval design and evaluation, and will also consider the practical aspects of how these theories have been implemented in actual systems. These topics will be examined through readings, discussion, hands-on experience using various information retrieval systems, and through participation in evaluation of different retrieval algorithms on various test collections. The prerequisite for the course is INFOSYS 202, though this may be waived with the consent of instructor. A good familiarity with computers and programming is highly desirable.      Info 247. Information Visualization and Presentation (3units)  Instructor(s): Michael Porath  Time: TuTh 3:30-5 Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41605 Website Information visualization is widely used in media, business, and engineering disciplines to help people analyze and understand the information at hand. The industry has grown exponentially over the last few years. As a result there are more visualization tools available, which have in turn lowered the barrier of entry for creating visualizations. This course provides an overview of the field of Information Visualization. It follows a hands-on approach. Readings and lectures will cover basic visualization principles and tools. Labs will focus on practical introductions to tools and frameworks. We will discuss existing visualizations and critique their effectiveness in conveying information. Finally, guest speakers from the industry will give an insight into how information visualization is used in practice. All students are expected to participate in class discussion, complete lab assignments, and create an advanced interactive data visualization as a semester project. Priority for attending this class is given to I School students. The semester project involves programming; therefore students are expected to have some coding experience. Interested students from other departments are invited to join the class if they can demonstrate the required skills.     Info C262. Theory and Practice of Tangible User Interfaces (4units)  Instructor(s): Kimiko Ryokai  Time: MW 2-3:30 (Lab: M 3:30-4:30) Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41611 Website This course will explore the theory and practice of Tangible User Interfaces, a new approach to HCI which focuses on the physical interaction with computational media. The topics covered in the course include:  Theoretical framework of Tangible User Interfaces Design examples of Tangible User Interfaces Enabling technologies for Tangible User Interfaces  Students will design and develop experimental Tangible User Interfaces, applications, underlying technologies, and theories using concept sketches, posters, physical mockups, working prototypes, and a final project report. The course will have 3 hours of lecture and 1 hour of laboratory per week. Note: Previously listed as Info 290:Theory and Practice of Tangible User Interfaces. Students who completed INFO 290 section 4 in Fall 2008 will receive no credit for Info 262.  This course is cross-listed as New Media C262.  Special Topics Courses    Info 290. Proseminar in the Digital Humanities (Sec2) (3units)  Instructor(s): Marti Hearst  Time: M 9-12 Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41615 Website This course will bring together students from the humanities who want to learn how technology can change how they do research, and students from information and computer science who want to help build the next generation of tools for humanities scholars, with a focus on analysis of written literature. Students from each discipline will be expected to be open to learning from the other.  The course will consist of readings and discussion of research papers as well as analysis and evaluation of existing tools. Students will be expected to contribute to the design, analysis, and/or evaluation of a new software tool for scholarly literature analysis. Information and computer science students should have experience or backgrounds in some subset of database programming, XML design, graphic design, user interface design, information visualization, natural language processing, machine learning, data mining and/or statistical analysis as well as general programming skills. Humanities students should have an open mind and a passion to learn about new techniques. Open to graduate students in all fields and upper-division undergraduates by permission of instructor.     Info 290. Innovation and Information (Sec3) (3units)  Instructor(s): Clark Kellogg  Time: F 9-12 Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41616 In your present and future work, you will increasingly face what have  been called wicked problems. They are volatile, uncertain, complex,  and ambiguous. Dealing with them requires new ways of thinking about  issues and new ways of innovative leadership. This class focuses on  having you learn about and practice some of the processes and tools   drawn from the fields of critical thinking, design thinking, systems  thinking and creative problem solving  that will help you grapple with  the wicked problems presented to you in school and beyond.  Specifically, well work with ways of collecting information to  characterize a problem, framing and re-framing that problem, coming up  with a range of solutions and then gathering feedback to assess those  solutions. Well work in a learn-by-doing mode in five zones:  observations, insights, ideas, solutions and stories and apply those  processes and tools to designing and redesigning in real settings. NOTE: Class attendance is required during the first week of instruction. Students who do not attend during the first week will be dropped from the class.     Info 290. Game Design: Combining Standards & Processes with Creativity & Innovation (Sec4) (2units)  Instructor(s): Alex Thayer  Time: M 5-7 Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41878 Kultima and Kuittinen (2011) characterize the gaming industry as follows: As a hybrid of engineering and arts, the game industry seems to be essentially coupled with constant change, whether it is change within one project and game concept, change in personnel and company structures, change in production models and tools or business models, contents, platforms, and consumer base the systematization and standardization of [game design] processes face the challenge of change. Given that designing games is such a dynamic process, this course will focus on deeper topics that inform the design of interesting, enjoyable games regardless of the latest trends. For example, consider the recent rise of gamification and its application to everything from the software test process to call center operations to exercise regimes. Before gamification, the buzzword among digital gaming researchers was serious. Everyone wanted to talk about serious games as opposed to casual games, which had been the hot topic only the year before. And prior to that, there was plenty of speculation about what might become the first truly popular massively multiplayer online game (MMOG). World of Warcraft concluded that discussion with a flourish by the end of 2006 when nearly 6 million players had subscribed to the game. That number nearly doubled by 2009, although as of July 2012 the game has 9.1 million subscribers.  This course does not teach any specific software tools for prototyping graphics engines, nor will you learn how to model characters in 3D or get your mobile app to the top of the best-seller list. Instead, this course is designed to help you understand the processes that underpin innovation and creativity, as well as the history and future of the digital gaming industry. By studying and experimenting with tools that will help you systematize your creative thoughts and innovative concepts, you will become a better game designer. Expect to learn a little bit about how creative thinking works, a little bit more about different development models in use within the digital gaming industry, and quite a lot about how to hone your creative ideas as tools to generate game designs and design ideas.  The course will be run in a colloquium style, which means you can expect a couple of readings each week that you and your peers will review and present to the rest of us. You will also get a taste for the intense pressures of game development cycles by working in teams on game ideas. You will complete this course with multiple portfolio pieces that highlight your ability to take a game concept from idea to prototype, collaborate with others in the process of developing that idea, reflect critically on your design processes, and harness your creative thinking.     Info 290. The Future of E-books (Sec5) (1-2units)  Instructor(s): Robert Glushko  Time: M 12-2 Location: 107 South Hall CCN: 41617 This is a hands on course that will address two major challenges associated with the current shift from text-based to e-books: making them more engaging and informative through use of the capabilities of the medium, and identifying and analyzing the issues surrounding the collaborative authoring and usage of e-books in an educational context. Course may be repeated for credit, as new issues will be explored. (In Fall 2012, this course was offered for 1 unit.)     Info 290. Doctoral Research and Theory Workshop (Sec6) (2units)  Instructor(s): Coye Cheshire  Time: M 10:30-12:30 Location: 202 South Hall CCN: 41620 This is a 2-hour, intensive weekly discussion of current and ongoing research by Ph.D. students with a research interest in issues of information (social, legal, technical, theoretical, etc). Thus, we welcome Ph.D.  students from inside and outside the ISchool who focus on these issues. Our goal is to focus on critiquing research problems, theories, and methodologies from multiple perspectives so that we can produce high-quality, publishable work in the interdisciplinary area of information research.  We welcome a mix of older and newer Ph.D.  students, which usually means we will have a mix of dissertation chapters from some and potential qualifying papers from others. For newer PhD\'s, a separate article or very new project idea might make more sense. No matter what you present to the group, the goal will be to compliment, critique, and suggest specific improvements. We want to have critical and productive discussion, but above all else we want to make our work better: more interesting, more accessible, more rigorous, more theoretically grounded, and more like the stuff we enjoy reading.     Info 290. Data Mining and Analytics in Intelligent Business Services (Sec7) (3units)  Instructor(s): Jim Blomo  Time: F 2-5 Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41622 The purpose of this course is to train students in:  Data mining and big data analytics (and a subset of topics in information retrieval, extraction, and machine learning);  Providing an intelligent business services context (in areas and topics such as digital marketing and computational advertising, financial analytics, healthcare analytics, service analytics, energy analytics, social media and social networks)  Specifically, we hope to:  Provide an overview of issues and trends which will shape the need for and structures of data mining, information extraction, and analytics in business information systems within areas and industries such as online marketing and ads, healthcare, financial services, energy services, social media and networks, and service centers. Identify and explore key topics, followed by the development of analytic methods, for data mining, analytics, and information extraction, in these contexts  We will have industry speakers and industry projects as well, to provide real-world perspective and real-world engagement.

Media, New and Otherwise (Sec2) (1units)  Instructor(s): Roy Bahat  Time: M 4-6 (January 28 - March 18) Location: 202 South Hall CCN: 41632 News, online, movies, advertising, television, mobile, videogames, music, books, social media all part of the industry of informing and entertaining, and all being revolutionized. In this course we will do a quick overview of the media business from startups to global conglomerates. We will address a wide range of topics: the economics of media organizations (and industries), their organizational structures, cultures, brands, and approaches. Some of the questions we\'ll discuss:  How do traditional media address changing technologies? How is the media business driven by metrics and data? How is it driven by artistic creativity? Are media companies too big? Are they too small?  Students will present strategies for media companies, hear from guest speakers, and discuss the transformations happening in media. Students should expect to have significant input into the companies and topics we discuss. We will make every attempt to avoid predictions about the future; we might occasionally succeed. Note: This course is cross-listed in the Haas School of Business. May not be taken for credit if student has previously taken Info 290: Media, New and Otherwise.     Info 290M. Information-Centric Entrepreneurship & Startup Strategies  (2units)  Instructor(s): John Danner  Time: Th 9-11 Location: 202 South Hall CCN: 41636 Every business depends on information about customers, competitors, trends, performance, etc. Entire curricula have been focused on the technological, systems, strategic, and management challenges associated with that dependency. This course, however, looks at a different intersection between information and business. Specifically, it will explore how entrepreneurs across the world are developing ventures fundamentally centered on new and emerging information technologies and the business models and strategies they make possible. These include not only the Googles, Amazons, and Facebooks of the world, but also ventures like Comat and Samasource. In some cases, these are efforts on the proverbial cutting edge of technology; more often they involve creative application and/or integration of existing information technologies in innovative ways. We will first examine the key elements of business models and the entrepreneurial process, before looking in more detail at a variety of ventures leveraging information-based technologies and strategies in an array of markets. Using of mix of case-study discussion, short lectures, and focused conversations with active entrepreneurs, this will be a highly interactive and collaborative course not a sit-listen-take-notes type of class. Expect to be actively involved in a series of in-class and outside assignments, both individual- and team-based, that will help you develop an understanding of how entrepreneurs are using information-centric technologies to create new markets and redefine old ones, and the lessons learned along the way. You may also explore your own ideas for new ventures along the way. NOTE: This course was previously offered as 290. Information-Centric Entrepreneurship & Startup Strategies.     Info 290MA.

Technology and Delegation (Sec4) (2units)  Instructor(s): Deirdre Mulligan  Time: M 2-4 Location: 205 South Hall CCN: 41655 Information technology has been integrated into an array of complex  interactions between individuals and the state. Often these  technological changes are put forth as inevitable progress toward modernization and as  value-neutral means for acting upon policies established through the  political branch of government. However, the adoption or introduction of  specific technology can obscure profound policy choices and options.  Obscurity can arise due to barriers to transparency created by law, such  as intellectual property rights asserted to prevent the analysis of  software code used in electronic voting systems, due to a lack of  necessary expertise to understand the ramifications of a technological  shift within the public and private sector entities focused on the  relevant policy issues, or, more fundamentally, due to shifts in  technology that remove or shift the assumptions on which earlier  policies were developed. As a result, the agency, the public, and the  political branch of government may overlook the policy-implications in  the choice of a new technology. Through case studies this class will  explore existing examples where discretion has been delegated to, or  embedded in technology, mechanisms that have or could be used to limit  and manage this delegation, and techniques for early identification of  inappropriate delegations.      Info 296A. Digital Activism (Sec5) (2units)  Instructor(s): Xiao Qiang  Time: Th 4-6 Location: 107 South Hall CCN: 41881 This participatory class explores civic engagement and political activism in the information age, through the lens of technology-enabled collective action. We will focus on both the theory and real-world cases of the Internet mobilizing people by spreading alternative views and news  and the parallel emergence of collective identity and civic action.

The Web is an open and constantly evolving system which can make it hard to understand how the different parts of the landscape fit together. This course provides students with an overview of the Web as a whole, and how the individual parts it together. We briefly look at topics such as Web design and Web programming, but this course is not exclusively designed to teach HTML or JavaScript. Instead, we look at the bigger picture and how and when to use these and other technologies.  The Web already is and will remain a central part in many information-related activities for a long time to come, and this course provides students with the understanding and skills to better navigate and use the landscape of Web information (for example, Wikipedia), Web technologies (for example, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), Web tools (for example, delicious and Yahoo pipes), and common Web patterns (for example, mashups). May not be taken for credit if student has taken 190-02 (Spring 2009 or Spring 2010).     Info 155.

Technology and Poverty (3units)  Instructor(s): Elisa OregliaNeha Kumar  Time: MWF 2-4:30 (Session A: May 28 - July 3, 2013) Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 49825 This course will encourage students to think broadly about the interplay between technological systems, social processes, economic activities, and political contingencies in efforts to alleviate poverty.  Students will come to understand poverty not only in terms of high-level indicators, but from a ground-level perspective as the poor experience and describe it for themselves.  The role played by individuals and societies of the developing world as active agents in processes of technology adoption and use will be a central theme.  Technologies connection to socio-economic development efforts will be put into historical context by exposing students to several phases of intensive interest including the green revolution, the push towards industrialization, the appropriate technologies movement, and more recent interest in digital technologies. Introductory material for the course will challenge students to think about exactly how technology is defined and about the wide variation amongst devices/systems covered by the term.  Course topics will be explored through a series of case studies that will be supplemented by cross-disciplinary readings.  The use of illustrative case studies will make the course accessible to undergraduates with diverse disciplinary backgrounds.  In our discussion of information technologies we will explore not only key form factors such as computers, the Internet, and mobile phones, but also their incorporation into broader practices such as micro-business and agriculture.

User Interface Design and Development (4units)  Instructor(s): Tapan Parikh  Time: TuTh 11-12:30 Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41605 Three hours of lecture per week. User interface design and human-computer interaction. Examination of alternative design. Tools        and methods for design and development. Human- computer interaction. Methods for measuring and evaluating interface quality. This course covers the design, prototyping, and evaluation of user interfaces to computers which is often called Human-Computer  Interaction (HCI). It is loosely based on course CS1 described in the ACM SIGCHI Curricula for Human-Computer Interaction (Association for Computing Machinery, 1992). HCI covers many topics including:   Human capabilities (e.g., visual and auditory perception, memory, mental models, and interface metaphors);  Interface technology (e.g., input and output devices, interaction styles, and common interface paradigms); and, Interface design methods (e.g., user-centered design, prototyping, and design principles and rules), and interface evaluation (e.g., software logging, user observation, benchmarks and experiments).   This material is covered through lectures, reading, discussions, homework assignments, and a course project. This course differs from CS 160 primarily in two ways:   There is an emphasis on interfaces for information technology applications; and,  There is less emphasis on programming and system development, although some simple prototyping (for example, in visual basic or using JAVA GUI development tools) may be required. (CS 160 has a big programming project.)      Info 219. Privacy, Security, and Cryptography (3units)  Instructor(s): Doug Tygar  Time: TuTh 2-3:30 Location: 205 South Hall CCN: 41608 This course will survey results in computer security, cryptography, and privacy, with an emphasis on work done in the last 3 years.

Intellectual Property Law for the Information Industries (3units)  Instructor(s): Brian Carver  Time: MW 10:30-12 Location: 205 South Hall CCN: 41611 Three hours of lecture per week. This course will provide an overview of the intellectual property laws with which information managers need to be familiar. It will start with a consideration of trade secrecy law that information technology and other firms routinely use to protect commercially valuable information. It will then consider the role that copyright law plays in the legal protection of information products and services. Although patents for many years rarely were available to protect information innovations, patents on such innovations are becoming increasingly common. As a consequence, it is necessary to consider standards of patentability and the scope of protection that patent affords to innovators. Trademark law allows firms to protect words or symbols used to identify their goods or services and to distinguish them from the goods and services of other producers. It offers significant protection to producers of information products and services. Because so many firms license intellectual property rights, some coverage of licensing issues is also important. Much of the course will concern the legal protection of computer software and databases, but it will also explore some intellectual property issues arising in cyberspace.     Info 242. XML Foundations (3units)  Instructor(s): Erik Wilde  Time: MW 2-3:30 Location: 202 South Hall CCN: 41613 Three hours of lecture. The Extensible Markup Language (XML), with its ability to define formal structural and semantic definitions for metadata and information models, is the key enabling technology for information services and document-centric business models that use the Internet and its family of protocols. This course introduces XML syntax, transformations, schema languages, and the querying of XML databases. It balances conceptual topics with practical skills for designing, implementing, and handling conceptual models as XML schemas.     Info 253. Web Architecture (3units)  Instructor(s): Jim Blomo  Time: F 2-5 Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41614 This course is a survey of Web technologies, ranging from the basic technologies underlying the Web (URI, HTTP, HTML) to more advanced technologies being used in the the context of Web engineering, for example structured data formats and Web programming frameworks. The goal of this course is to provide an overview of the technical issues surrounding the Web today, and to provide a solid and comprehensive perspective of the Web\'s constantly evolving landscape.

Topics include part-of-speech tagging, shallow parsing, text classification, information extraction, incorporation of lexicons and ontologies into text analysis, and question answering. Students will apply and extend existing software tools to text-processing problems.     Info 257. Database Management (3units)  Instructor(s): Ray Larson  Time: TuTh 12:30-2 Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41617 Three hours of lecture per week. This course is concerned with the use of Database Management Systems (DBMS) to solve a wide range of information storage, management and retrieval problems, in organizations ranging from large corporations to personal applications, such as research data management. The course combines the practical aspects of DBMS use with more theoretical discussions of database design methodologies and the "internals" of database systems. A significant part of the course will require students to design their own database and implement it on different DBMS that run on different computer systems. We will use both ACCESS and ORACLE. In the theoretical portion of the course, we will examine the major types or data models of DBMS (hierarchical, network, relational, and object-oriented). We will discuss the principles and problems of database design, operation, and maintenance for each data model.     Info C262.

Quantitative Research Methods for Information Systems and Management (3units)  Instructor(s): Coye Cheshire  Time: TuTh 3:30-5 Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41623 The goal of this course is to provide students with an introduction to many different types of quantitative research methods and statistical techniques. This course will be divided into two sections: 1) methods for quantitative research and, 2) quantitative statistical techniques for analyzing data. We begin with a focus on defining research problems, theory testing, causal inference, and designing research instruments. Then, we will explore a range of statistical techniques and methods that are available for empirical research. Topics in research methods include: Primary and Secondary Data Analysis, Sampling, Survey Design, and Experimental Designs. Topics in quantitative techniques include: Descriptive and Inferential statistics, General Linear Models, and Non-Linear Models. The course will conclude with an introduction to special topics in quantitative research methods.  Special Topics Courses    Info 290. Multimedia Narrative (Sec2) (3units)  Instructor(s): Nancy Van House  Time: TuTh 11-12:30 Location: 205 South Hall CCN: 41626 Visual and multi-modal media are central to much of what we do in the I  School and related disciplines. Data collection, reports, and  presentations, face-to-face and distant, online and off, often rely  heavily on visual and audio media. Because we are a media-literate  society, with accessible hardware and software plus easy online  distribution, it seems that everyone knows" how to make and critique  such media. However, our knowledge about how to effectively make, use,  and present these media trails far behind our ability to create hours  and gigabytes of content. Furthermore, its useful to consider how these  resources are changing not just professional and research practice.   In this seminar, we will address both theoretical and practical issues  of capturing and creating narratives with video, audio, and still  images. We will draw on photojournalism, visual narrative, visual  anthropology, visual studies, and related areas. We will get hands-on  experience creating and editing our own media. This is not a technical  course; nor is it a media production how-to. But you will get experience  with media technologies while we reflect on them with the help of  theoreticians and scholars in relevant areas.   This course is relevant to students in professional schools and to  doctoral students interested in and qualitative research, including user  experience research; technology designers who produce video scenarios and  concept videos; and anyone concerned with collecting and presenting  information via multiple media.   No prior experience is necessary, but students who are already grappling  with visual (and audio) media will find this course especially useful. I  School students are likely to find this course useful for the doing and  presenting of final projects.     Info 290.

Designing Mobile Experiences (Sec4) (2units)  Instructor(s): Suzanne Ginsburg  Time: TBA Location: TBA CCN: 41632 The mobile landscape is constantly changing  new devices, new operating systems, new applications. Even seasoned designers are overwhelmed by the chaos, sometimes creating less than optimal designs that are soon outdated. But the successful designs, the ones that surprise and delight their users, look beyond the here and now. The first part of this course will provide the foundation to create remarkable mobile designs that can truly stand the test of time. Some of the topics we\'ll cover include: exploratory mobile research, mobile prototype development, and gesture design. The latter part of the course will delve into device differences and responsive design, a technique that can help minimize the challenges associated with cross-platform support. Course material will be covered through lectures, readings, and a group project     Info 290. The Future of E-books (Sec5) (1-2units)  Instructor(s): Robert Glushko Scott Abel Time: Tu 3:30-5:30 Location: 205 South Hall CCN: 41635 This is a hands on course that will address two major challenges associated with the current shift from text-based to e-books: making them more engaging and informative through use of the capabilities of the medium, and identifying and analyzing the issues surrounding the collaborative authoring and usage of e-books in an educational context. Course may be repeated for credit, as new issues will be explored. (In Fall 2012, this course was offered for 1 unit.)     Info 290. Applied Behavioral Economics for Information Systems (Sec6) (3units)  Instructor(s): Steven Weber  Time: TuTh 2-3:30 Location: 210 South Hall CCN: 41638 What is commonly called "Behavioral Economics" is one but only one important perspective on how information impacts practical aspects of human behavior. There are others, ranging from simple game theory to social influence to incentives and reputation. The goal of this class will be to deploy a relatively few selected and important theories about the relationship between information and behavior, into practical settings  emphasizing the design of experiments that can now be incorporated into many \'applications\' in day-to-day life. So called \'smart systems\' are not being fully leveraged when we don\'t build into them testable propositions about how human behavior is and can be modified by what they tell us and do for us. So let\'s design these experiments into our systems from the ground up! The goal of this class is to develop a practical point of view on how to do that more effectively and with greater impact. NOTE: In Fall 2011, this course was listed with the title How Information Would, Should, and Could Change Human Behavior.     Info 290.

Finding Health in the US: Health Care and the Information Economy (Sec2) (1units)  Instructor(s): Scott Young Sean Hennessey Time: F 1-3 (September 6 - October 25) Location: 202 South Hall CCN: 41647 Health and health care have profound impact on a society\'s well being and economic productivity. Health care reform and ongoing economic forces are placing unprecedented pressure on the health care system to provide consumers and payers with value. Patients, purchasers, regulators, and other key stakeholders are demanding that care be readily accessible, proactive, and focused on improving health while containing costs. The health care system, policy makers, and key stakeholders are responding by developing new care models that focus on patient and customer centricity, novel information practices, and the seamless integration of care.  Following a review of the current trends in health care, the course will explore the relationship between health care and the information economy. We will also delve into information strategies being utilized by health care providers, patients, payers, and other key stakeholders to improve care while controlling costs. Health care leaders from Kaiser Permanente will serve as guest lecturers, providing tangible perspective to our discussions.     Info 290A.

What Theory Matters (Sec4) (1units)  Instructor(s): Jean LavePaul Duguid  Time: Tu 3:30-6 (October 29 - December 3) Location: 107 South Hall CCN: 41653 This short seminar will explore differences among theoretical  perspectives by asking:    What does it mean to have a theoretical perspective? How do you come to recognize different theoretical stances as you  read and consider the work of others? What are the implications of those differences for scholarly work  and social engagement with the world?    One way to take up these questions is to look closely at how  scholars/researchers approach the same problem from different  perspectives. The course will take as a central text for this  examination Understanding Practice:  Perspectives on Activity and  Context (Chaiklin and Lave, editors).  All researchers in this  collection of ethnographic studies address issues about learning,  knowledge and social practice.  The challenge for the seminar is to  inquire into the theoretical stances that permeate these projects   similarly and differently.  This will involve attempting to answer the  seminar questions as we go along.   Besides being more acute readers  of academic work by the end of the seminar, students will have (we  hope) a hands-on grasp of the craft of social theorizing, and an  introduction to contrasting theories of learning, knowledge, context,  and practice.

The Federal Trade Commission and Online Privacy (Sec3) (3units)  Instructor(s): Deirdre Mulligan  Time: M 2-5 Location: 107 South Hall CCN: 41671 The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has emerged as the primary  regulator of online privacy. In a recent case, the FTC marked the end of  contract law approaches to online privacy in favor of a more  interventionalist approach. Years of protecting consumers against harm  has evolved to an attempt to protect consumer dignity in online  commerce. This transition has profound implications for US online  commerce. In grounding privacy rights in dignitary interests, the line  between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors will become less clear.  Those wishing to represent online businesses should have a strong  understanding of this agency, its norms, and approaches to address  clients business challenges. This seminar will explore the agencys  dominance in the law of online privacy and security, its policy  approaches, and in particular, how it should address growing concern  over online privacy.  Students will be required to prepare a significant  policy document on the FTC that will be shared with the agencys  leadership. Additionally, students will author a shorter paper focusing  upon some aspect of the FTC or its leadership. (We post these on  wikipedia.org).
